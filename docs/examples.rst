Examples
========

Here you can find several examples of simulations with ARTES. Links are provided to the input files with some easy instructions included.

Limb polarization image from a Rayleigh scattering atmosphere
-------------------------------------------------------------

The first example simulates an image in backward direction from a Rayleigh scattering atmosphere. The output includes images of all Stokes parameters and the image below is created with the plot_image.py routine in the tools folder. The image shows the Stokes I flux and the vectors denote the direction and degree of polarization. The input files can be downloaded `here <https://people.phys.ethz.ch/~stolkert/artes/limb_polarization.tar.gz>`__.

Phase curve from a Rayleigh scattering atmosphere
-------------------------------------------------

The second example simulates a Rayleigh scattering atmosphere as well but the output is a phase curve, that is, the disk-integrated flux along the different phases (i.e., scattering angles) of the planet. The images show the Stokes I flux (green) in comparison with Lambert surfaces (dasked lines) and the fractional polarization. The input files can be downloaded `here <https://people.phys.ethz.ch/~stolkert/artes/rayleigh.tar.gz>`__.

Reflected light spectrum from a Jupiter-like planet
---------------------------------------------------

The next example simulates the reflected light spectrum from a gaseous atmosphere with methane absorption at a scattering angles of 90 degress (see Stam et al. 2004). The images show the spectrum of the normalized Stokes I the degree of polarization (with low spectral resolution). The input files can be downloaded `here <https://people.phys.ethz.ch/~stolkert/artes/jupiter.tar.gz>`__.

Emission spectrum from a self-luminous planet
---------------------------------------------

This example simulates the emission spectrum from a self-luminous gas giant with a clear atmosphere. Molecule opacities and mixing ratios are interpolated from a pre-calculated with equilibrium chemistry. The input files can be downloaded `here <https://people.phys.ethz.ch/~stolkert/artes/selfluminous.tar.gz>`__.

Reflected light image of a planet with a circumplanetary disk
-------------------------------------------------------------

This last simulates the reflected light image of a planet that is surrounded by a disk/ring at a phase angle of 76 degrees. The image shows the Stokes I surface brightness. The input files can be downloaded `here <https://people.phys.ethz.ch/~stolkert/artes/circumplanetary.tar.gz>`__.
